Apologies for the confusion. In the previous script, the `givenPath` variable was hardcoded for demonstration purposes. To provide the folder path dynamically, you can modify the script to prompt the user for the folder path using the `choose folder` dialog. Here's the updated script:

```applescript
-- Function to check if a string contains any illegal characters
on containsIllegalCharacters(theString)
    set illegalCharacters to "[\\/:*?\"<>|]" -- List of illegal characters
    
    -- Check if the string contains any illegal characters
    considering case
        if theString contains characters of illegalCharacters then
            return true
        else
            return false
        end if
    end considering
end containsIllegalCharacters

-- Function to remove leading and trailing spaces from a string
on trimString(theString)
    set trimmedString to theString
    set beginningTrimmed to true
    set endingTrimmed to true
    
    -- Remove leading spaces
    repeat while beginningTrimmed
        considering case
            if (text 1 of trimmedString) is equal to " " then
                set trimmedString to text 2 thru -1 of trimmedString
            else
                set beginningTrimmed to false
            end if
        end considering
    end repeat

    repeat while endingTrimmed
        considering case
            if (text -1 of trimmedString) is equal to " " then

            else
                set endingTrimmed to false
            end if

            end if
        end repeat
    end tell
end checkAndCorrectNames
